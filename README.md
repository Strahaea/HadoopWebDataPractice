# Hadoop Web Data Practice
Second part of the project in Lesson3 for Udacity/Cloudera's Intro to Hadoop/Mapreduce Course. 
Uses python mappers and reducers on HDFS to analyze a large dataset (500MB) containing web access information stored in Common Log format. 
Probes the dataset for information such as the number of page hits, number of hits from different iPs, and the most requested path.

The dataset used (access_log) can be downloaded from the course materials section of Udacity's Intro to Hadoop and Mapreduce course.
